##  File Structure & Purpose

At the root level, files like `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, and `next.config.js` are responsible for configuration, project metadata, build scripts, and Tailwind CSS customization. Environment variables for Firebase credentials are managed via `.env.local`.

### lib/firebase.ts

Initializes and exports Firebase services — Auth, Firestore, Storage, and GoogleAuthProvider — based on the environment configuration.

### app/layout.tsx

Global layout file that wraps all routes and pages. It includes shared elements like headers, footers, and theme providers.

### app/page.tsx

The main landing page of the app. It gives a quick overview of the app and links to all major functionalities.

##  Running the Project Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Add Firebase credentials in .env.local

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

##  Disclaimer

The hospital list displayed on the /curated page currently uses mock data fetched via a Google-based Mock API for demonstration and testing purposes.
This mock dataset simulates real hospital profiles including names, specializations, and addresses.
Once SwasthyaConnect is certified and officially integrated with government healthcare systems and hospitals:
Verified hospital data will be fetched through Hospital Management Systems (HMS) provided by respective hospitals.
Live data such as ICU/general bed availability, oxygen stock, and emergency status will be displayed in real time.
Goal: Ensure only authenticated and government-approved hospitals are visible in the app with accurate, trusted data.
